We observe that although the nonlinear structure governs the first order approximation, the nonlinear effect is absorbed as an external source term of a linear equation in the second and higher order approximation. Moreover, we find that the geometric shape of the initial data has to be chosen carefully according to the effective Hamiltonian, in order to achieve the higher order convergence rates."

We discover the appearance of the initial layers, which appear naturally when we consider the systems with different initial data and analyze them rigorously. In particular, we obtain matched asymptotic solutions of the systems and the rate of convergence.

The proof consists of two major steps. The first, which is actually the only place in the paper where probability plays a role, establishes the rate for special (quadratic) data using the methodology developed by the authors and Wang to study the homogenization of nonlinear uniformly elliptic pde in general stationary ergodic random media. The second is a general argument, based on the new notion of $\delta$-viscosity solutions which is introduced in this paper, that shows that rates known for quadratic can be extended to general data. As an application of this we also obtain here rates of convergence for the homogenization in periodic and almost periodic environments. The former is algebraic while the latter depends on the particular equation.},

  abstract  = {The classical first-order Hamilton-Jacobi equation $u^\epsilon _t+H(Du^\epsilon ,x/\epsilon )=0$ has a unique viscosity solution satisfying an initial condition uε = u0 when t = 0. When H is periodic in the second variable, it is known that uε converges as ε → 0 to the unique viscosity solution of the "averaged equation" ut + H̄(Du) = 0, with the same initial condition. In this paper, we assume that H is convex and we use optimal control theory to establish a relationship between the effective Hamiltonian H̄ and a nonlinear "additive" eigenvalue equation. For any convex Hamiltonian H, we prove existence and uniqueness of this additive eigenvalue, and we derive a variational formula for H̄.},

We are interested in particular solutions of the above equation which are required to be supersolutions, in a suitable weak sense, of the same equation up to the boundary of Ω. This requirement plays the role of a boundary condition. The main motivation for this kind of solution comes from deterministic optimal control and differential games problems with constraints on the state of the system, as well from related questions in constrained geodesics.},

Our method combines a comparison principle with the observation that, under suitable assumptions, the convex envelope of the solution is a supersolution. This property relies on the characterization of the viscosity subject of the convex envelope of a lower semicontinuous coercive function. The equation solved by the conjugate of a convex solution as well as partial convexity are topics we also discuss.

Notre méthode repose sur le principe de comparaison et sur l'observation que, sous des hypothèses convenables, l'enveloppe convexe d'une solution est une sursolution. Cette dernière propriété utilise une caractérisation du sous différentiel d'ordre deux (au sens de la théorie des solutions de viscosité) de l'enveloppe convexe d'une fonction coercive, semicontinue inférieurement. Des questions connexes sont traitées, comme la convexité partielle de solutions ou l'équation que doit vérifier la conjuguée d'une fonction convexe.},

The proof consists of two major steps. The first, which is actually the only place in the paper where probability plays a role, establishes the rate for special (quadratic) data using the methodology developed by the authors and Wang to study the homogenization of nonlinear uniformly elliptic pde in general stationary ergodic random media. The second is a general argument, based on the new notion of $\delta$-viscosity solutions which is introduced in this paper, that shows that rates known for quadratic can be extended to general data. As an application of this we also obtain here rates of convergence for the homogenization in periodic and almost periodic environments. The former is algebraic while the latter depends on the particular equation.},
