Under the assumption that for each z ∈ ∂G there exists az ∈ A, where A denotes the control set, such that the diffusion matrix σ(x,a) vanishes for a = az and for x ∈ ∂G in a neighborhood of z and the drift vector b(x,a) directs inside of G at z for a = az and x = z as well as some other mild assumptions, we establish the unique existence of a continuous viscosity solution of the state constraint problem for the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, prove that the value functions V associated with the constraint Ḡ, Vr of the relaxed problem associated with the constraint Ḡ, and V0 associated with the constraint G, satisfy in the viscosity sense the state constraint problem, and establish Hölder regularity results for the viscosity solution of the state constraint problem.},

	abstract = {Providing an introduction to stochastic optimal control in inﬁnite dimension, this book gives a complete account of the theory of second-order HJB equations in inﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, focusing on its applicability to associated stochastic optimal control problems. It features a general introduction to optimal stochastic control, including basic results (e.g. the dynamic programming principle) with proofs, and provides examples of applications. A complete and up-to-date exposition of the existing theory of viscosity solutions and regular solutions of second-order HJB equations in Hilbert spaces is given, together with an extensive survey of other methods, with a full bibliography. In particular, Chapter 6, written by M. Fuhrman and G. Tessitore, surveys the theory of regular solutions of HJB equations arising in inﬁnite-dimensional stochastic control, via BSDEs. The book is of interest to both pure and applied researchers working in the control theory of stochastic PDEs, and in PDEs in inﬁnite dimension. Readers from other ﬁelds who want to learn the basic theory will also ﬁnd it useful. The prerequisites are: standard functional analysis, the theory of semigroups of operators and its use in the study of PDEs, some knowledge of the dynamic programming approach to stochastic optimal control problems in ﬁnite dimension, and the basics of stochastic analysis and stochastic equations in inﬁnite-dimensional spaces.},

	abstract = {We consider the homogenization of Hamilton–Jacobi equations and degenerate Bellman equations in stationary, ergodic, unbounded environments. We prove that, as the microscopic scale tends to zero, the equation averages to a deterministic Hamilton–Jacobi equation and study some properties of the effective Hamiltonian. We discover a connection between the effective Hamiltonian and an eikonal-type equation in exterior domains. In particular, we obtain a new formula for the effective Hamiltonian. To prove the results we introduce a new strategy to obtain almost sure homogenization, completing a program proposed by Lions and Souganidis that previously yielded homogenization in probability. The class of problems we study is strongly motivated by Sznitmanʼs study of the quenched large deviations of Brownian motion interacting with a Poissonian potential, but applies to a general class of problems which are not amenable to probabilistic tools.
Résumé
On considère la question de lʼhomogénéisation des équations de Hamilton–Jacobi et équations de Bellman dégénérées dans un environnement stationnaire, ergodique et non borné. On démontre que, lorsque lʼéchelle microscopique tend vers zéro, lʼéquation sʼhomogénéise en une équation de Hamilton–Jacobi déterministe, on étudie certaines propriétés de lʼHamiltonien effectif. On établit une relation entre lʼHamiltonien effectif et une équation de type eikonal dans un domaine extérieur. En particulier, on obtient une nouvelle formule pour le hamiltonien effectif. Pour démontrer ces résultats, on introduit une nouvelle stratégie pour obtenir de lʼhomogénéisation presque sure, complétant ainsi un programme proposé par Lions et Souganidis qui fournissait des résultats dʼhomogénéisation en probabilité. La classe de problèmes quʼon étudie est fortement motivée par lʼétude de Sznitman des grandes déviations avec extinction pour le mouvement Brownien interagissant avec un potentiel de Poisson, mais sʼapplique à une classe générale de problèmes qui ne se prêtent pas à lʼutilisation dʼoutils probabilistes.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the well-posedness of a type of state constraint ergodic Mean Field Game system in a bounded domain in which the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation is paired with an infinite Dirichlet boundary condition. In this setting, the infinite boundary condition prevents the underlying stochastic trajectories from reaching the boundary, resulting in a state constraint solution. We consider a class of superlinear power-like Hamiltonians and establish existence and uniqueness results under appropriate assumptions on the coupling. We treat both non-local and local couplings, and establish the uniqueness of the system by exploiting the decay of the density near the boundary.},

	abstract = {In this article, we are interested in the large time behavior of solutions of the Dirichlet problem for subquadratic viscous Hamilton–Jacobi equations. In the superquadratic case, the third author has proved that these solutions can have only two different behaviors: either the solution of the evolution equation converges to the solution of the associated stationary generalized Dirichlet problem (provided that it exists) or it behaves like −ct+φ(x) where c⩾0 is a constant, often called the “ergodic constant” and φ is a solution of the so-called “ergodic problem”. In the present subquadratic case, we show that the situation is slightly more complicated: if the gradient-growth in the equation is like {\textbar}Du{\textbar}m with m{\textgreater}3/2, then analogous results hold as in the superquadratic case, at least if c{\textgreater}0. But, on the contrary, if m⩽3/2 or c=0, then another different behavior appears since u(x,t)+ct can be unbounded from below where u is the solution of the subquadratic viscous Hamilton–Jacobi equation.
Résumé
Dans cet article, nous nous intéressons au comportement en temps grands des solutions du problème de Dirichlet pour des équations de type Hamilton–Jacobi visqueuses dans le cas sous-quadratique. Dans le cas sur-quadratique, le troisième auteur a prouvé que ces solutions ne peuvent avoir que deux comportements : ou bien la solution du problème d'évolution converge vers la solution du problème stationnaire associé (à condition qu'elle existe) ou bien elle se comporte comme −ct+φ(x) où c⩾0 est une constante, souvent appelée “constante ergodique” et φ est la solution du “problème ergodique”. Dans le cas sous-quadratique, nous montrons que la situation est plus complexe : si le terme en gradient dans l'équation croît comme {\textbar}Du{\textbar}m avec m{\textgreater}3/2, alors le comportement est analogue au cas sur-quadratique, au moins si on a c{\textgreater}0. Au contraire, si m⩽3/2 ou si c=0, alors un autre comportement apparait car, si u est la solution de l'équation Hamilton–Jacobi visqueuse, u(x,t)+ct peut être non minoré.},

	abstract = {The linear response theory has given a general proof of the fluctuationdissipation theorem which states that the linear response of a given system to an external perturbation is expressed in terms of fluctuation properties of the system in thermal equilibrium. This theorem may be represented by a stochastic equation describing the fluctuation, which is a generalization of the familiar Langevin equation in the classical theory of Brownian motion. In this generalized equation the friction force becomes retarded or frequency-dependent and the random force is no more white. They are related to each other by a generalized Nyquist theorem which is in fact another expression of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. This point of view can be applied to a wide class of irreversible process including collective modes in many-particle systems as has already been shown by Mori. As an illustrative example, the density response problem is briefly discussed.},

We emphasize the comparison technique invented by Hopf to prove this principle, which has since become a main mathematical tool for the study of second order elliptic partial differential equations and has generated an enormous number of important applications. While Hopf's principle is generally understood to apply to linear equations, it is in fact also crucial in nonlinear theories, such as those under consideration here. In particular, we shall treat and discuss recent generalizations of the strong maximum principle, and also the compact support principle, for the case of singular quasilinear elliptic differential inequalities, under generally weak assumptions on the quasilinear operators and the nonlinearities involved. Our principal interest is in necessary and sufficient conditions for the validity of both principles; in exposing and simplifying earlier proofs of corresponding results; and in extending the conclusions to wider classes of singular operators than previously considered. The results have unexpected ramifications for other problems, as will develop from the exposition, e.g. (i)two point boundary value problems for singular quasilinear ordinary differential equations (Sections 3 and 4);(ii)the exterior Dirichlet boundary value problem (Section 5);(iii)the existence of dead cores and compact support solutions, i.e. dead cores at infinity (Section 7);(iv)Euler–Lagrange inequalities on a Riemannian manifold (Section 9);(v)comparison and uniqueness theorems for solutions of singular quasilinear differential inequalities (Section 10).

We establish interior weighted W1,q-regularity estimates for weak solutions to the equations for every q {\textgreater} p assuming that the weak solutions are in the local John-Nirenberg BMO space. This paper therefore improves available results because it replaces the boundedness or continuity assumption on weak solutions by the borderline BMO one. Our regularity estimates also recover known results in which A is independent of the variable u. Our regularity theory complements the classical C1,α- regularity theory developed by many mathematicians including DiBenedetto and Tolksdorf for this general class of quasi-linear elliptic equations.},

We have included every topic that we think essential for the training of analysts, and we have also gone down a number of interesting bypaths. We hope too that the book will be useful as a reference for mature mathematicians and other scientific workers. Hence we have presented very general and complete versions of a number of important theorems and constructions. Since these sophisticated versions may be difficult for the beginner, we have given elementary avatars of all important theorems, with appro­ priate suggestions for skipping. We have given complete definitions, ex­ planations, and proofs throughout, so that the book should be usable for individual study as well as for a course text. Prerequisites for reading the book are the following. The reader is assumed to know elementary analysis as the subject is set forth, for example, in TOM M. ApOSTOL'S Mathematical Analysis [Addison-Wesley Publ. Co., Reading, Mass., 1957], or WALTER RUDIN'S Principles of Mathe­ nd matical Analysis [2 Ed., McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York, 1964].},

	abstract = {Consider a Hamiltonian system with Hamiltonian of the form H(x;t;p) where H is convex in p and periodic in x ,a ndt and x2 R 1 . It is well-known that its smooth invariant curves correspond to smoothZ 2 -periodic solutions of the PDE ut +H(x;t;u)x =0 : In this paper, we establish a connection between the Aubry-Mather theory of invariant sets of the Hamiltonian system andZ 2 -periodic weak solutions of this PDE by realizing the Aubry-Mather sets as closed subsets of the graphs of these weak solutions. We show that the complement of the Aubry-Mather set on the graph can be viewed as a subset of the generalized unstable manifold of the Aubry-Mather set, defined in (2.24). The graph itself is a backward-invariant set of the Hamiltonian system. The basic idea is to embed the globally minimizing orbits used in the Aubry-Mather theory into the characteristic fields of the above PDE. This is done by making use of one- and two-sided minimizers, a notion introduced in [12] and inspired by the work of Morse on geodesics of type A [26]. The asymptotic slope of the minimizers, also known as the rotation number, is given by the derivative of the homogenized Hamiltonian, defined in [21]. As an application, we prove that theZ 2 -periodic weak solution of the above PDE with given irrational asymptotic slope is unique. A similar connection also exists in multidimensional problems with the convex Hamiltonian, except that in higher dimensions, two-sided minimizers with a specified asymptotic slope may not exist. c 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

	abstract = {The convergence of spectra via two-scale convergence for double-porosity models is well known. A crucial assumption in these works is that the stiff component of the body forms a connected set. We show that under a relaxation of this assumption the (periodic) twoscale limit of the operator is insufﬁcient to capture the full asymptotic spectral properties of high-contrast periodic media. Asymptotically, waves of all periods (or quasi-momenta) are shown to persist and an appropriate extension of the notion of two-scale convergence is introduced. As a result, homogenised limit equations with none trivial quasi-momentum dependence are found as resolvent limits of the original operator family. This results in asymptotic spectral behaviour with a rich dependence on quasimomenta.},

Here the Hamiltonian H\{\vphantom{\}}x,u,p) = {\textbackslash}p{\textbackslash} — n\{\vphantom{\}}x) is independent of u, and so the uniqueness of a viscosity solution of the Dirichlet problem for (0.2) is not a direct consequence of the uniqueness theory mentioned above. It is usually deduced from the uniqueness theory after converting equation (0.2) into equation (0.1) with a strictly increasing Hamiltonian H\{\vphantom{\}}x,u,p) in u via a transformation of the unknown (a device of S. N. Kruzkov (9)). Indeed, if u is a viscosity solution of (0.2), then the function v = —e{\textasciitilde}u is a viscosity solution of n\{\vphantom{\}}x)v + {\textbackslash}Dv{\textbackslash} — 0. We refer the interested reader to Kruzkov (9), and P. L. Lions (10) and (2) for the details of this approach. The main purpose here is to present a new, direct proof of the uniqueness theorem for a class of Hamilton-Jacobi equations including (0.2) as a special case in the framework of viscosity solutions. §1 contains comparison results which yield the desired uniqueness theorem. An example of application of our comparison theorem is presented in §2. Our techniques are also useful in proving the rate of convergence of the vanishing viscosity method. This subject will be discussed in (7).},

	abstract = {We study the growth rate of the inclusion length of an almost periodic function. For a given a. p. function such growth rate depends on the algebraic structure of Fourier exponents, i. e. on how good they can be approximated by rational numbers. In additional, as appears from the definition, the inclusion length carries some information about the translation numbers (almost periods). Our result is a lower bound of the growth rate of the inclusion interval of a quasiperiodic function (theorem 3). Here we use methods from dimension theory. We do not assume anything about exponents, but rationally independence. This suggest an idea that this lower bound can be reached (in asymptotic sense) for some "bad" exponents. Koichiro Naito in his papers on estimates of the fractal dimension of almost periodic attractors proved an upper bound of the inclusion length for some class of a.p. functions, using simultaneous Diophantine approximations. For the special case of badly approximable exponents we can see that the both estimates (if we consider them as asymptotic estimates) are coincide (see theorem 4). We hope that ideas and results presented in this paper can be useful not only to understand the nature of badly approximable numbers and almost periods, but also for more detailed understanding of the structure of almost periodic attractors.},

In the sub-ballistic regime (on the flat spot), we show that the fluctuations are governed by an entirely different mechanism and the homogenization may proceed, without further assumptions, at an arbitrarily slow rate. We identify a necessary and sufficient condition on the law of the Hamiltonian for an algebraic rate of convergence to hold in the sub-ballistic regime and show, under this hypothesis, that the two rates may be merged to yield comprehensive error estimates and an algebraic rate of convergence for homogenization.},

	abstract = {We consider nonlinear, uniformly elliptic equations with random, highly oscillating coefficients satisfying a finite range of dependence. We prove that homogenization and linearization commute in the sense that the linearized equation (linearized around an arbitrary solution) homogenizes to the linearization of the homogenized equation (linearized around the corresponding solution of the homogenized equation). We also obtain a quantitative estimate on the rate of this homogenization. These results lead to a better understanding of differences of solutions to the nonlinear equation, which is of fundamental importance in quantitative homogenization. In particular, we obtain a large-scale \$C{\textasciicircum}\{0,1\}\$ estimate for differences of solutions---with optimal stochastic integrability. Using this estimate, we prove a large-scale \$C{\textasciicircum}\{1,1\}\$ estimate for solutions, also with optimal stochastic integrability. Each of these regularity estimates are new even in the periodic setting. As a second consequence of the large-scale regularity for differences, we improve the smoothness of the homogenized Lagrangian by showing that it has the same regularity as the heterogeneous Lagrangian, up to \$C{\textasciicircum}\{2,1\}\$.},

The solutions constructed are weak solutions in the viscosity sense, and our construction follows work of Ishii (Duke Math. J.,55 (2) 369–384, 1987). The same general approach appears in work of Andrews and Feldman (J. Differential Equations, 182 (2) 298–343, 2002) in which they show existence for a weak nonlocal parabolic flow of convex curves. The time independent special case of their work leads to a one dimensional elliptic result which we extend to two dimensions. Similar results are required to extend their theory of nonlocal geometric flows to surfaces.},

Finally, in the appendix, we show that our new method and those a priori formulas from the periodic setting can be used to obtain stochastic homogenization for the same class of nonconvex Hamilton–Jacobi equations.

The proof consists of two major steps. The first, which is actually the only place in the paper where probability plays a role, establishes the rate for special (quadratic) data using the methodology developed by the authors and Wang to study the homogenization of nonlinear uniformly elliptic pde in general stationary ergodic random media. The second is a general argument, based on the new notion of δ-viscosity solutions which is introduced in this paper, that shows that rates known for quadratic can be extended to general data. As an application of this we also obtain here rates of convergence for the homogenization in periodic and almost periodic environments. The former is algebraic while the latter depends on the particular equation.},

Our central goal is to understand the relation between 𝑉V\{V\} and 𝐻⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯H¯\{{\textbackslash}overline\{H\}\}. We formulate some inverse problems concerning this relation. Such types of inverse problems are, in general, very challenging. In this paper, we discuss several special cases in both convex and nonconvex settings.},

	abstract = {For a scalar, first order ordinary differential equation which depends periodically on time, Massera's Theorem says that the existence of a bounded solution implies the existence of a periodic solution. Though the statement is false when periodicity is replaced by quasi-periodicity, solutions with some kind of recurrence are anyway expected when the equation is quasi-periodic in time. Indeed we first prove that the existence of a bounded solution implies the existence of a solution which is quasi-periodic in a weak sense. The partial differential equation, having our original equation as its equation of characteristics, plays a key role in the introduction of this notion of weak quasi-periodicity. Then we compare our approach with others already known in the literature. Finally, we give an explicit example of the weak case, and an extension to higher dimension for a special class of equations.},

	abstract = {The convergence of spectra via two-scale convergence for double-porosity models is well known. A crucial assumption in these works is that the stiff component of the body forms a connected set. We show that under a relaxation of this assumption the (periodic) two-scale limit of the operator is insufficient to capture the full asymptotic spectral properties of high-contrast periodic media. Asymptotically, waves of all periods (or quasi-momenta) are shown to persist and an appropriate extension of the notion of two-scale convergence is introduced. As a result, homogenised limit equations with none trivial quasi-momentum dependence are found as resolvent limits of the original operator family. This results in asymptotic spectral behaviour with a rich dependence on quasimomenta.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the Fourier analysis methods have expereinced a growing interest in the study of partial differential equations. In particular, those techniques based on the Littlewood-Paley decomposition have proved to be very efficient for the study of evolution equations. The present book aims at presenting self-contained, state- of- the- art models of those techniques with applications to different classes of partial differential equations: transport, heat, wave and Schrödinger equations.  It also offers more sophisticated models originating from fluid mechanics (in particular the incompressible and compressible Navier-Stokes equations) or general relativity.

It is either directed to anyone with a good undergraduate level of knowledge in analysis or useful for experts who are eager to know the benefit that one might gain from Fourier analysis when dealing with nonlinear partial differential equations.},
